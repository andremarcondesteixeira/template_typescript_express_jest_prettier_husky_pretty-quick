# Boilerplate Nodejs with Typescript project

## Prerequisites

This boilerplate uses the "@tsconfig/node16-strictest/tsconfig.json" base tsconfig file.
Because of that, it expects NodeJS >= 16.

## What you get:

-   Express
-   Typescript
-   Eslint with Typescript support
-   Jest with Typescript support (your test code must be written in typescript)
-   Prettier
-   Husky (formats your code before each commit using a package called "pretty-quick")

## Recommendations:

In Visual Studio Code, install the following extensions:

-   "EditorConfig for VS Code", from EditorConfig
-   "Prettier - Code Formatter", from Prettier
-   "ESLint", from Microsoft

## Rationale

-   Since I use VSCode, and VSCode uses double quotes when automatically importing modules, I decided to use double-quotes by default for all strings
